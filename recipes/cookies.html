    <h2 class="description">Description</h2>
    <p>This is the greatest cookie to ever be baked. I promise that you'll most likely
        cry as soon as you bite into this mystical, magical cookie.</p>
    <p>It is also extra near and dear to my heart because I love the person who makes these for me.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul class="listing">
        <li>2 1/2 C all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>1 tsp Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 sticks unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 C granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 C brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tsp vanilla extract</li> 
        <li>2 large eggs <em>(room temperature)</em></li>
        <li>2 1/2 C semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>coarse sea salt for sprinkling</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol class="listing">
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a stand mixer (using the paddle attachment) or using a handheld mixer, beat the granulated sugar, brown sugar, and softened unsalted butter on medium-high speed until light and fluffy. Then, beat in eggs, one at a time. Add vanilla extract and mix.</li>
        <li>Adjust mixer to low speed. Gradually add the flour mixture and mix until well combined.</li>
        <li>Using a rubber spatula, fold in chocolate chips.</li>
        <li>Cover dough with plastic wrap, making sure the plastic wrap touches the dough. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. <em>If you refrigerated the dough overnight, let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes.</em></li>
        <li>Line 2 large baking sheet pans with parchment paper. Rolls into balls (about 1.5 tablespoons) and place onto the prepared baking sheet about 2-3 inches apart so they have room to expand.</li>
        <li>Gently press a few extra chocolate chips into the cookie dough balls. Bake 10-11 minutes until edges are golden brown.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with some sea salt as soon as you remove them from the oven. Let cool before devouring them!</li>
    </ol>
